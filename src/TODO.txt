Gameplay: 
- Rotation speed
- Drift
- Line with repeatable texture
- Projectiles that can follow target
- You lost screen
- Game state
- Highlighting ships
- Ship Stats UI
- Gamepad X/Y axis isn't working properly
- Physics similar collision resolving

Engine:
- Create collider from prefab
- Reassign changed animation to editing ship AddEventToEditingAnimation
- Refactor animation events
- Refactor input handling
- Refactor object creation
- Object initialization from (binary data?) prefabs
- Asset storing in binary formats
- Precalculate ui positions only if parent updated
- UI Flexible Y layout 
- Polygon collision -- Optimisation
- Chunk collision detection
- Bezire animations
- Collision detection as independent component
- Animation / animation handling as independent component
- Split components for separate update
- Sprite shape detection -- Rectangle detection done; make Polygon
- Multiplayer
Done: 
- Animation events 
- UI parenting/childrening
- UI flexible layout (X axis)
- UI drawing and detecting
- Ship state control
- Better ui button click detection - callback now
